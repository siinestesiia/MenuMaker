# Menu Maker

This program will be able to create a set of blank A4 pages and then
fill them with text for a restaurant menu. The idea is to automate the
creation of a menu, and also the task to update prices for all items, 
fields, or single items.
Also the program will be able to change the visual style, and font to look
more appealing.

The items and its prices will be pulled from a dictionary.

In the future the program will be adapted to run on a web browser and be
more user friendly. For now, it just works on a console.
